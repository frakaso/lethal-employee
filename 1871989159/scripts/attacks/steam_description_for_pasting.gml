A rioter from the timeline Clairen left. An expert in improvised explosives. While the power of flame is lost, his driving rage keeps his embers smouldering.

Mollo is an aggressive, technical fighter. His strong attacks throw bombs rather than attacking normally, so you'll need to combo them into the blast radius of them! Charging the attack cooks the bomb, making it explode sooner after it leaves your hand.
 His Neutral Special changes which type of bomb he throws next, from a stunning flashbang to a powerful finisher!

Some other notes:
-His Strong attacks can be angled further by tilting the left stick (or whatever you have for movement) perpendicular to the direction you're throwing. Forward strong can tilt up and down, while Up and Down strong can tilt left and right.
-His Forward Aerial and Down Aerial bounce off of opponents if the attack lands.
-Holding Down while taunting turns his thumbs up into a thumbs down, for extra disrespect.
